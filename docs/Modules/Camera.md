 ### Cameras have a representation in the node graph and can be animated.
 ### An important aspect is that the camera itself is also part of the scene-graph.

 ## Functions:

 ### GetCameraName


- Result: 
```
Returns name of the camera .
```

 ### GetCameraFOV

- Result: 
```
 Half horizontal field of view angle, in radians.
```

 ### GetClipPlaneNear

- Result: 
```
Distance of the far clipping plane from the camera.
```

 ### GetClipPlaneFar

- Result: 
```
Distance of the far clipping plane from the camera.
```


 ### GetAspectRatio


- Result: 
```
Screen aspect ratio.
```

 ### GetPosition


- Result: 
```
Position of the camera relative to the coordinate space. defined by the corresponding node.
```

 ### GetUpVector


- Result: 
```
'Up' vector of the camera coordinate system relative to the coordinate space defined by the corresponding node.
```

 ### GetLookAtVector

- Result: 
```
'LookAt' - vector of the camera coordinate system relative to the coordinate space defined by the corresponding node.
